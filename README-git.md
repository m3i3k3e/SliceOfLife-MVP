# Unity Git Quick Start (Unity 6)

**Keep these in Git:** `Assets/` (your stuff), `Packages/` (manifest + lock), `ProjectSettings/` (project config).
**Never commit:** `Library/`, `Temp/`, `Obj/`, `Builds/`, logs, or giant local-only asset packs.

If you must keep big binaries (textures/audio/video/FBX), Git LFS is already configured by `.gitattributes`.
