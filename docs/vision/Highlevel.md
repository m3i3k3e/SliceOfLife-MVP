\# High-Level Vision



\_Last updated: 2025-08-09\_



\## Pillars (what we never compromise)

\- \*\*Incremental-first\*\*: numbers go up even if sessions are short.

\- \*\*Tactical spikes\*\*: quick, satisfying card battles break the idle rhythm.

\- \*\*Cozy-dark humor\*\*: cheeky tone; suggestive but not explicit.

\- \*\*Modular systems\*\*: every feature ships as a self-contained slice.



\## Audience \& Tone

\- Adults 18–45 (primarily male). Isekai/harem/dark-comedy fans.

\- “Sexy, silly, a bit mean—never cruel.” No explicit porn; no real-world politics.



\## Narrative Frame (1 paragraph)

\- You reincarnate into a rundown tavern’s \*\*basement camp\*\*… \_(1–3 sentences on vibe \& stakes)\_



\## Content Boundaries (clear lines)

\- ✅ Suggestive outfits, flirtatious text, pin-up portraits, some NSFW sexual themes and suggestive interactions/minigames.



\## Release Path

\- \*\*Itch demo → Early Access → Steam\*\*. Single-OS (Windows) until EA stabilizes.



\## Success Metrics (MVP)

\- 10–15 min loop retention (Day 2).

\- 30% of demo players reach dungeon win ≥3 times.

\- 50% of buyers play ≥3 sessions in first week.



\## Risks \& Mitigations

\- \*\*Scope creep\*\* → “One new verb per milestone” rule.

\- \*\*Art pipeline\*\* → lock portrait spec + batch generate.

\- \*\*Balance churn\*\* → economy worksheet + scripted test runs.



\## North-Star Screenshot List

\- Start hub (basement) with \*\*Altar\*\*, \*\*Bed\*\*, \*\*Dungeon Door\*\*.

\- Battle scene with \*\*3 cards\*\*, \*\*HP bars\*\*, \*\*reward popup\*\*.

\- Upgrades panel (SO-driven).
